# customWifiListening

Custom Python script using Scapy to enumerate WiFi probes and link the results with Wifiphisher Script.

It is recommended to have to WiFi interfaces. One to listen in this script, and the other one to create the Fake AP with Wifiphisher.

Thanks to https://github.com/yadox666 for the great Scapy tips!
