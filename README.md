# customWifiListening - Presented in the event Mundo Hacker Day 2018 in Madrid, Spain

Custom Python script using Scapy to enumerate WiFi probes and link the results with Wifiphisher Script (https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher).

It is recommended to have 2 WiFi interfaces. One to listen in this script, and the other one to create the Rogue AP with Wifiphisher.

Thanks to https://github.com/yadox666 for the great Scapy tips!
